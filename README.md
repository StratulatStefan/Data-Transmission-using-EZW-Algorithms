# Data-Transmission-using-EZW-Algorithms

## The embedded zerotree wavelet algorithm (EZW) is a simple, yet remarkably effective, image compression algorithm having the property that the bits in the bit stream are generated in order of importance, yielding a fully embedded code.
  * Key concepts
    * Discrete wavelet transform or hierarhical subband decomposition
    * Prediction of the absence of significant information across scales by exploiting the self-similarity inherent in images
    * Entropy-coded succesive-approximation quantization
    * Universal lossless data compression which is achieved via adaptive arithmetic coding
